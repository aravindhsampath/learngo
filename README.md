# Learn Go
Toy programs written while learning Go. 

Programs are mostly the same from [freeCodeCamp.org's Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU&amp;list=PL5JTGAxs-XMKwPj91Im-sE85UYTF2To6m&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) and [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/) with comments and experimentation notes by and for myself.
